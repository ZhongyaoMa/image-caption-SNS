# Image Caption for Social Network Posts
Data-X Project \
Team: Yangyiying Pu, Zhongyao Ma, Joanne Jiang, Huidi Wang, Chengwu Shen.

1. We first used the apify-py-script.py file to collect current posts on Instagram associated with specific hashtags. We downloaded 3000+ pictures (uploaded 10 as examples in this "/images" folder due to memory limitation) and their hashtags (saved in the pickle file).\
2. Then we trained a model with image processing and natural language processing, as the model.py contained.\
3. Finally we built a UI with Python Flask and all associated files are in the UI folder. Demo video attached in the last slide of the presentation.
